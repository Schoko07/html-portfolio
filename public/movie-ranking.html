<h1>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h1>
<hr />
<ol>
    <h3><li>The Lord of the Rings: Trilogy</li></h3>
    <p>Not only due to the critical acclaims it has garnered but the essence of the world built by a great author was created within the trilogy. Not everyone will like it due to the sheer length of he movie, but it is a must watch.</p></li>
    <h3><li>Kimi no Nawa</li></h3>
    <p>Simply beautiful anime movie with great visuals and soundtrack, and a wonderfully laid out plot.</p>
    <h3><li>Violet Evergarden</li></h3>
    <p>Artistic and mesmerising visual and soundtrack.</p>
